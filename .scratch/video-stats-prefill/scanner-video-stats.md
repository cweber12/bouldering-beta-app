# Handoff: Video Stats prefill — POST crops at calibration, verify suggested labels

**Audience:** an agent working in the **Beta Scanner** repo (the Next.js pose/ORB
app). You do not need the analysis harness repo open to do this work — this doc
gives you the new endpoint contract, the artifact it writes, and what the
scanner's calibration flow must change so condition labels are *verified* by the
user instead of authored from memory.

**Companion docs:** the scanner data contract (bundle layout, the
`analysisInputs` block this feature prefills — lives in the harness repo) and
[scanner-calibration-freshness.md](../calibration-freshness/scanner-calibration-freshness.md)
(the `setupHash` staleness rules this feature reuses).

Harness issue: [#23](https://github.com/cweber12/beta-scan-analysis/issues/23).

## The problem this solves

Almost every video-condition Predictor is a hand label picked from memory at
calibration, and most bundles ship with `"unknown"` in most fields. The harness
now computes continuous image stats automatically in two phases:

- **Phase 1 (source stats)** — whole-frame stats at download/import, stored in
  the bundle's `metadata.json` (`video_stats` block). No scanner involvement.
- **Phase 2 (region stats)** — wall color/texture, climber–wall contrast, and a
  shadow block, computed from the calibration crops **when the scanner POSTs
  them**. Stored in a new per-bundle `video-stats.json` stamped with the
  `setupHash` it was computed under.

From these stats the harness derives **suggested labels** for the fields the
user previously authored blind. The scanner's job: call the endpoint
mid-calibration, prefill the `analysisInputs` form from the response, and record
per-label provenance so the human-verified layer stays auditable.

---

## Probe first: `GET {HARNESS_API_BASE}/api/contract`

The harness self-describes. Probe once at scanner startup (and cache for the
session):

```json
{
  "service": "beta-scan-analysis-harness",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "endpoints": ["/api/contract", "/api/detections", "/api/download",
                "/api/import", "/api/routes", "/api/video-stats", "/api/vitpose"],
  "artifacts": {"vitpose": 1, "videoStats": 1},
  "suggestions": {"available": true, "fitDate": "2026-07-19",
                  "corpusSize": 39, "labeledBundles": 27}
}
```

Gate on it instead of assuming:

- Enable the prefill flow only when `"/api/video-stats"` is in `endpoints`
  **and** `suggestions.available` is true (thresholds unfit — the endpoint
  still computes stats but returns no suggestions — skip prefill, keep the
  manual form).
- `apiVersion` mismatch (scanner expects 1) or probe failure → show a visible
  "harness out of date / unreachable" state and degrade to the manual flow.
  Never let a contract mismatch surface as a silent mid-calibration 404.

## The endpoint: `POST {HARNESS_API_BASE}/api/video-stats`

Synchronous (unlike `/api/vitpose`): decodes ~30 sampled frames and responds in
a few seconds. Call it **after saving `setup.json`** (crops drawn) and before
showing the `analysisInputs` form.

Request (camelCase and snake_case field names are both accepted; everything but
`routeFolder`/`videoKey` is optional and falls back to the bundle's just-saved
`setup.json`, so the minimal call is just the two identifiers):

```json
{
  "routeFolder": "planet-x",
  "videoKey": "jGa4kCQkXaQ_20260711-185530",
  "climberCrop": {"x": 0.48, "y": 0.73, "w": 0.27, "h": 0.27},
  "wallCrop":    {"x": 0.24, "y": 0.0,  "w": 0.53, "h": 0.95},
  "climberPoint": {"x": 0.59, "y": 0.98, "t": 0},
  "panning": false,
  "setupHash": "<hash of the setup.json this calibration just saved>"
}
```

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "routeFolder": "...", "videoKey": "...",
  "setupHash": "<echoed provenance anchor>",
  "artifactPath": ".../video-stats.json",
  "regionStats": { "wall": {...}, "climberWall": {...}, "shadow": {...},
                   "panningFlagged": false, "sampledFrames": 30 },
  "suggestions": {
    "shadows": "none|solid|patchy",
    "climber_contrast": "low|medium|high",
    "wall_contrast": "low|medium|high",
    "motion_blur": "low|medium|high",
    "camera_stability": "steady|moving"
  }
}
```

Errors: `400` no wall crop resolvable (request or setup.json) or bad path; `404`
unknown bundle or missing video binary; `500` decode/compute failure. On any
error, fall back to the current hand-authoring flow — the endpoint is an
enhancement, never a gate on calibration.

Notes:

- `suggestions` keys are the snake_case `analysisInputs` label keys; only labels
  whose driving stat resolved are present. Treat a missing key as "no
  suggestion" and leave that field at `"unknown"` for the user.
- The harness writes `video-stats.json` itself — the scanner never writes this
  artifact. Recalibration must simply re-POST; the harness overwrites and
  re-stamps (`setupHash`), exactly the Ground Truth staleness pattern.
- Suggestion thresholds are corpus-fit constants in the harness
  (`video_stats.SUGGESTION_THRESHOLDS`, fit 2026-07-19 over 39 bundles).
  `camera_stability` is a strong fit (balanced acc 0.97 vs existing labels);
  the contrast/blur bands are distribution-calibrated first passes — expect the
  user to override them, that's the point of verify-not-author.

## Work items

### 0. Contract probe at startup

Fetch `/api/contract` once at startup (or first harness call), cache it, and
gate work items 1–5 on it as described above. This is the drift check that
keeps the two programs honest with each other — treat "probe failed" and
"probe succeeded but feature not advertised" as the same degraded state.

### 1. Calibration flow reorder: crops drawn → POST → prefill → verify → save

After the user finalizes crops and `setup.json` is saved (with its new
`setupHash`), POST `/api/video-stats`, then render the `analysisInputs` form
**prefilled** from `suggestions`. The user confirms or overrides each field,
then the labels are saved into `setup.json.analysisInputs` as today
(snake_case keys, per the data-contract doc).

- Show suggested values visually distinct from user-set ones (e.g. a subtle
  "suggested" affordance) until confirmed.
- Fields with no suggestion (`route_orientation`, `camera_angle`, `occlusion`,
  `notes`) stay manual, defaulting to `"unknown"`/empty as today.

### 2. Per-label provenance in `analysisInputs`

Record, per suggested label, whether the saved value was auto-accepted or
human-overridden, so downstream analysis can weigh them differently. Write a
sibling block in `setup.json` (additive — the harness pipeline keeps reading
`analysisInputs` unchanged):

```json
"analysisInputsProvenance": {
  "shadows": "auto-accepted",
  "climber_contrast": "human-overridden",
  "camera_stability": "auto-accepted",
  "route_orientation": "human-authored"
}
```

Vocabulary: `auto-accepted` (suggestion kept as-is), `human-overridden`
(suggestion shown, user changed it), `human-authored` (no suggestion existed).
Labels untouched by the user in an old bundle simply have no provenance entry.

### 3. Shadows vocabulary migration (+ climber-shadow option)

Suggestions use a **structural** shadows vocabulary: `none | solid | patchy`
(replacing the intensity grades `low|medium|high`). Update the form options to:

```text
shadows: none | solid | patchy | climber | unknown
```

`climber` (the climber casts the significant shadow) is human-only — the
automation cannot detect it yet, so it is never suggested; keep it selectable.
Old bundles keep their legacy values; no migration of stored labels.

### 4. Re-POST on recalibration

Every calibration save that produces a new `setupHash` must re-POST
`/api/video-stats` so the artifact tracks the current crops. (If you already
rebuilt the calibration-save pipeline for the freshness handoff, this is one
more step in that same sequence, before the ViTPose job kicks off or in
parallel with it — the two are independent.)

### 5. (Optional) surface the ViTPose camera-angle estimate

The harness ViTPose job now writes a `cameraAngle` block into
`video-stats.json` (`{"estimate": "level|high|low", "shoulderHipRatio": ...,
"source": "vitpose", "setupHash": "..."}`). The `camera_angle` hand label
remains authoritative and manual; if you want, display the estimate as a hint
next to the field (it arrives asynchronously with the ViTPose job, not in the
`/api/video-stats` response).

---

## What the harness does with this (context, no action needed)

- `video-stats.json` region stats become continuous Predictor columns in the
  correlation pipeline (`vs_*`), alongside phase-1 `src_*` columns; a
  `vs_stale` flag fires when the artifact's `setupHash` differs from a run's.
- The 39 existing bundles were backfilled (both phases) on 2026-07-19, stamped
  with their current `setupHash`es — so prefill works from the first
  recalibration onward.

---

## Verification

1. Calibrate a bundle in the scanner: after crops are drawn, confirm the
   `analysisInputs` form arrives prefilled and each suggested field is marked.
2. Accept one suggestion, override another, author a manual field; confirm
   `setup.json` carries `analysisInputs` + `analysisInputsProvenance` with
   `auto-accepted` / `human-overridden` / `human-authored` respectively.
3. Recalibrate with different crops: `video-stats.json` in the bundle must show
   the new `setupHash` and a fresh `computedAt`.
4. Kill the harness service and calibrate: the form must degrade to the manual
   flow (all fields `"unknown"`, no provenance for unsuggested labels), not
   block.
5. Harness side: `python -m analysis_pipeline analysis -o reports` — the run
   table gains `vs_*` columns for the recalibrated bundle with `vs_stale` false.

## Status

> **Instructions for the implementing agent:** update the table and log below as
> you land work. One row per work item; Status is
> `not-started | in-progress | blocked | done`, plus the scanner commit/PR.

| # | Work item                                      | Status | Commit/PR | Notes |
|---|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | Contract probe + feature gating                | done   | f53ed8c   | `utils/harnessContract.ts` (parse + gate, module-cached probe) over a new `/api/dev/contract` relay. Probe failure, apiVersion mismatch, missing endpoint, and unfit suggestions all surface as a visible degraded note in the label form; unfit suggestions still POST stats (artifact tracking) without prefill. |
| 1 | Flow reorder: POST → prefill → verify → save   | done   | f53ed8c   | Save setup only now saves → awaits the stats POST → opens the metadata form prefilled (suggested badge per applied field); closing it returns to the corpus. Suggestions fill only unlabelled (`unknown`/empty) fields — an existing human label always wins. The Confirm+seed path fires the POST in the background, in parallel with the ViTPose job. |
| 2 | Per-label provenance block                     | done   | f53ed8c   | `computeProvenance` (only fields with a suggestion shown, or touched this save) → `analysisInputsProvenance` through the merging setup PUT; validated server-side (strict vocabulary/keys), merged field-level, excluded from `setupHash`. |
| 3 | Shadows vocab migration + climber option       | done   | f53ed8c   | `shadows: unknown|none|solid|patchy|climber`; legacy grades retained off-scale, never migrated. Also aligned `occlusion` to the data contract's `none|some|heavy` and seeded the select combos with the contract vocabularies (`steady|some-shake|moving`, `left|right|head-on`, `low|level|high`). |
| 4 | Re-POST on recalibration                       | done   | f53ed8c   | Every successful setup PUT (save-only and confirm+seed) re-POSTs `/api/video-stats` with the fresh authoritative hash via the new `/api/dev/corpus/video-stats` relay. Failures degrade visibly, never gate the save. |
| 5 | (Optional) camera-angle hint                   | done   | f53ed8c   | The relay's GET reads the bundle's `video-stats.json`; the metadata form shows `ViTPose estimate: <level|high|low>` next to the `camera_angle` field, display-only. |

### Log

- 2026-07-19 — handoff written (harness agent). Endpoint, artifact, backfill,
  and fitted thresholds are live on the harness side.
- 2026-07-19 — merged to harness `main` (PR #27). Everything described here is
  now what a running harness service serves; the 39-bundle corpus carries both
  phases, stamped with current `setupHash`es. Scanner work can start.
- 2026-07-19 — `GET /api/contract` added on the harness; work item 0 (probe +
  feature gating) added accordingly.
- 2026-07-19 — all six work items landed in scanner commit `f53ed8c` (branch
  `feat/video-stats-prefill`). Also fixed the corpus list to read labels from
  `setup.json.analysisInputs` (legacy `metadata.json` passthrough kept as
  fallback only). Merge to `main` deferred until the in-flight batch re-seed
  sweep finishes — a hot reload of the harness page would drop the sweep's
  frozen queue. Manual verification steps 1–5 above remain to be run against a
  live harness after the merge.
